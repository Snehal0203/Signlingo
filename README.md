# Signlingo

*Signlingo uses Deep Learning to translate pictures of ASL into English, which we hope can help others understand sign language users better.**

## What it does ✨ 

Signlingo uses Deep Learning to translate pictures of ASL into English, which we hope can help others understand sign language users better.

## What's next for Signlingo ✨ 

We hope to add more ASL phrases and potentially create a sustainable web server with features that will implement leaderboard and achievement features to encourage users to use our translator more, and a dashboard that will allow users to review past translations. We also hope to make translation performance faster and smoother!
